# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project investigates how machine learning techniques can be used to detect fake news articles. It uses real and fake news datasets and walks through a full CRISP-DM-inspired data science process â€” including loading, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and evaluation, all within modular Jupyter/Colab notebooks.
