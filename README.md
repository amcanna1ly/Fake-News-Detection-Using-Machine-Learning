# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project investigates how machine learning techniques can be used to detect fake news articles. It uses real and fake news datasets and walks through a full CRISP-DM-inspired data science process â€” including loading, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and evaluation, all within modular Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

## Project Overview

This repository contains four notebooks, each representing a stage in the pipeline:

1. **IS619_Data_Loader.ipynb**  
   Loads and combines real and fake news datasets, assigns unique identifiers, and stores the unified dataset in a SQLite database.

2. **IS619_Data_Preprocessing&Validation.ipynb**  
   Cleans the data, merges article title and body into a `content` column, and performs a stratified split into training and testing sets.

3. **IS619_Data_Understanding.ipynb**  
   Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) using frequency analysis and word clouds to identify common tokens and patterns in fake vs. real articles.

4. **IS619_Modeling_Evaluation.ipynb**  
   Trains and evaluates multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Linear SVM) using TF-IDF features and outputs comparative performance metrics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

- `Fake.csv`: News articles classified as fake.
- `True.csv`: News articles classified as real.

Each file includes:
- `title`: Headline of the news article
- `text`: Body of the article
- `subject`: Category of the article
- `date`: Publication date

These are merged and labeled (1 for fake, 0 for real) during ingestion.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Languages**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `os`, `sqlalchemy`
  - `sklearn` for machine learning and evaluation
  - `nltk` for natural language processing
  - `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
  - `sqlite3` for lightweight data storage

---

## Machine Learning Models Evaluated

Each model is trained using TF-IDF vectorized text features:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Visual comparisons across models

## Database Structure

The project uses a single SQLite database (`fakenews.db`) containing:

| Table Name      | Description                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `news_article`  | Combined dataset from both CSV files       |
| `train_articles`| Preprocessed training set (80%)            |
| `test_articles` | Preprocessed testing set (20%)             |

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository and upload the CSV files (`Fake.csv`, `True.csv`) to the appropriate path.
2. Open the notebooks in order:
   - `IS619_Data_Loader.ipynb`
   - `IS619_Data_Preprocessing&Validation.ipynb`
   - `IS619_Data_Understanding.ipynb`
   - `IS619_Modeling_Evaluation.ipynb`
3. Run all cells sequentially in each notebook.
4. Review metrics and plots to analyze model performance.
